# Staff Approval Email Notification Feature

## Overview
This feature automatically sends email notifications to salon owners when their staff members are approved by an admin. The emails provide immediate feedback about new staff members who can now access the salon dashboard.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Staff Approval Notification Email
- **Trigger**: When a staff member is approved via admin panel or CLI tool
- **Recipients**: Salon owner's registered email address
- **Content**: 
  - Notification of staff approval
  - Staff name and position
  - Salon name
  - Professional styling with AuraCare branding

## Implementation Details

### Email Configuration
The email system uses Nodemailer with Gmail SMTP:
- Service: Gmail
- Authentication: EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS environment variables
- Template Engine: HTML with inline CSS for email client compatibility

### Email Function
Located in `backend/config/email.js`:
1. `sendStaffApprovalNotificationEmail(salonOwnerEmail, salonName, staffName, position)` - Sends staff approval notification to salon owner

### Integration Points
1. **Admin Controller** (`backend/controllers/adminController.js`):
   - `approveStaff` function sends notification email after database update

2. **CLI Management Tool** (`backend/manage_staff_approval.js`):
   - `approveStaff` function sends notification email

## Email Template

### Staff Approval Notification Template
```html
Subject: New Staff Member Approved - [Staff Name] ([Position])

Body:
- Header with AuraCare branding
- Personalized greeting to salon owner
- Confirmation message with staff name and position
- Green success box highlighting approval
- Professional footer with copyright
```

## Testing

### Test Script
`backend/test_staff_approval_email.js` - Tests email sending functionality

### Manual Testing
1. Approve a staff member via admin panel and verify email is sent to salon owner
2. Approve a staff member via CLI tool and verify email is sent to salon owner
3. Check email content for proper personalization

## Error Handling

### Email Delivery Failures
- Non-blocking: Email failures don't affect approval process
- Logging: Failed emails are logged with error details
- Retry: No automatic retry (admin can manually re-approve if needed)

### Configuration Issues
- Validation: Checks for EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS environment variables
- Verification: Tests email transporter configuration before sending
- Error Messages: Specific error messages for common issues (auth, connection)

## Security Considerations

### Email Content
- No sensitive information included in emails
- Professional language without exposing system details
- Branded templates to prevent phishing concerns

### Rate Limiting
- No rate limiting on email sending (assumed to be low volume)
- Admin actions are already rate-limited by authentication

## Future Enhancements

### Email Tracking
- Add email open tracking
- Add click tracking for dashboard links
- Delivery status monitoring

### Template Customization
- Locale-specific email templates
- Customizable email content per salon type
- Rich media content (images, logos)

### Retry Mechanism
- Automatic retry for failed emails
- Queue system for email delivery
- Dead letter queue for persistent failures
