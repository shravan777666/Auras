   - ✅ Storage configurations for customers, staff, and salons
   - ✅ Helper functions for image operations

2. **Image Upload Routes** (`backend/routes/imageUpload.js`)
   - ✅ Customer profile image upload endpoint
   - ✅ Staff profile image upload endpoint
   - ✅ Salon image upload endpoint

3. **Image Controller** (`backend/controllers/imageController.js`)
   - ✅ Controllers for handling image uploads
   - ✅ Proper URL handling for Cloudinary images
   - ✅ Error handling and response formatting

4. **Image Utilities** (`backend/utils/imageUtils.js`)
   - ✅ Helper functions for image operations
   - ✅ Public ID extraction from Cloudinary URLs
   - ✅ Image validation functions

5. **Server Configuration** (`backend/server.js`)
   - ✅ Image upload routes properly mounted
   - ✅ Available routes list updated

### Frontend
1. **Image Service** (`frontend/src/services/imageService.js`)
   - ✅ Service methods for all image operations
   - ✅ Proper API endpoint integration

2. **Image Upload Component** (`frontend/src/components/common/ImageUpload.jsx`)
   - ✅ Reusable React component for image uploads
   - ✅ File validation and preview functionality
   - ✅ Loading states and error handling

3. **Test Page** (`frontend/src/pages/customer/TestImageUpload.jsx`)
   - ✅ Dedicated test page for image upload functionality
   - ✅ Route added to App.jsx

## Environment Configuration

### Backend (.env)
```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dzbjcacnn
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=876578995275917
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=X5ELAMbkjO6-VOEMcAgc_0CNsfw
```

### Frontend (.env)
```env
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dzbjcacnn
VITE_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=876578995275917
```

### Render Deployment
Environment variables properly configured in `render.yaml`:
- ✅ Backend service includes Cloudinary credentials
- ✅ Frontend service includes public Cloudinary configuration

## API Endpoints

### Customer Profile Image
- `POST /api/image-upload/customer/profile` - Upload customer profile image

### Staff Profile Image
- `POST /api/image-upload/staff/profile` - Upload staff profile image

### Salon Image
- `POST /api/image-upload/salon/image` - Upload salon image

## Testing Results

### Connection Test
✅ Cloudinary connection successful
✅ Direct upload test passed
✅ Image deletion test passed

### Endpoint Test
✅ Image upload routes are properly mounted
✅ Authentication middleware working correctly
✅ Endpoints return appropriate responses

## Usage Instructions

1. **For Customers**: Navigate to profile edit page to upload profile picture
2. **For Staff**: Use staff profile edit page for profile picture uploads
3. **For Salons**: Use salon profile edit page for salon images
4. **Testing**: Visit `/customer/test-image-upload` to test functionality

## Benefits

1. **Scalable Storage**: Images stored on Cloudinary CDN
2. **Automatic Optimization**: Images automatically optimized for web delivery
3. **Responsive Images**: Automatic resizing and format conversion
4. **Secure Uploads**: Authenticated uploads with validation
5. **Global Delivery**: Fast image delivery through Cloudinary's global CDN

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. ✅ Verify Cloudinary credentials in environment variables
2. ✅ Check that image upload routes are properly mounted
3. ✅ Ensure frontend can access backend API endpoints
4. ✅ Test with the `/customer/test-image-upload` page

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test backend health
curl http://localhost:5011/health

# Test image upload endpoint (requires authentication)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5011/api/image-upload/customer/profile
```

The Cloudinary integration is fully functional and ready for production use.
