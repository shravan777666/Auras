## Test Results

✅ Cloudinary connection successful
✅ Direct upload test passed
✅ Image deletion test passed

## Integration Status

The Cloudinary integration is fully functional with the following components:

### Backend
- ✅ Cloudinary configuration (`backend/config/cloudinary.js`)
- ✅ Image upload routes (`backend/routes/imageUpload.js`)
- ✅ Image controller (`backend/controllers/imageController.js`)
- ✅ Image utilities (`backend/utils/imageUtils.js`)

### Frontend
- ✅ Image service (`frontend/src/services/imageService.js`)
- ✅ Image upload component (`frontend/src/components/common/ImageUpload.jsx`)
- ✅ Test page (`frontend/src/pages/customer/TestImageUpload.jsx`)

## Environment Configuration

### Backend (.env)
```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dzbjcacnn

CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=X5ELAMbkjO6-VOEMcAgc_0CNsfw
```

### Frontend (.env)
```env
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dzbjcacnn
VITE_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=876578995275917
```

### Render Deployment
Environment variables are properly configured in `render.yaml` for both backend and frontend services.

## Usage Instructions

1. Navigate to `/customer/test-image-upload` to test image uploads
2. Use the ImageUpload component in any form that requires image handling
3. Images will be automatically uploaded to Cloudinary and URLs stored in the database

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Verify Cloudinary credentials in environment variables
2. Check that the image upload routes are properly mounted in `server.js`
3. Ensure the frontend can access the backend API endpoints
