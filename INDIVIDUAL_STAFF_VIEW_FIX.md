# Individual Staff View Attendance Fix

## Issue Identified
The individual staff view in the `StaffAppointmentsCalendar.jsx` component was completely missing the attendance marking functionality. While the group view (`StaffAvailabilityCalendar.jsx`) had been updated with attendance buttons, the individual staff view did not have this feature at all.

## Root Cause
The `StaffAppointmentsCalendar.jsx` component, which is used for the individual staff view, did not include:
1. The attendance marking functions (`markAttendance` and `addShift`)
2. The UI buttons for marking attendance
3. The necessary imports for the required icons

## Solution Implemented
Added the missing attendance marking functionality to the `StaffAppointmentsCalendar.jsx` component:

1. **Added Required Imports** - Added `CheckCircle` and `Plus` icons to the existing imports
2. **Implemented Functions** - Added `markAttendance` and `addShift` functions similar to those in the other calendar component, placed within the component scope
3. **Added UI Buttons** - Added attendance/shift action buttons to each calendar cell
4. **Increased Cell Height** - Changed from `h-32` to `h-40` to accommodate both appointments and buttons
5. **Made Buttons Visible for All Dates** - Removed the `isToday` condition so buttons appear on all calendar days

## UI Changes
- Attendance/Shift action buttons are now visible in the individual staff view
- Calendar cells are taller (h-40) to accommodate the additional UI elements
- Buttons are visible for all dates, not just today
- Visual consistency maintained with today's date still highlighted

## Files Modified
1. `frontend/src/components/salon/StaffAppointmentsCalendar.jsx` - Added attendance marking functionality

## Verification
The changes ensure that:
- Both calendar views (group view and individual staff view) have attendance marking functionality
- The user workflow described in the documentation is now accurately reflected in both UI components
- Attendance buttons are visible in screenshots showing any month, not just the current date
